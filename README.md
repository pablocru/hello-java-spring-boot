# Java Spring Boot Learning Journey

This repository is a place where I document my learning journey in `Java Spring Boot`.
It’s designed to keep track of my progress and organize my exercises and notes. As I
continue to explore new topics and take additional courses, I will add relevant materials
here.

## Folder Structure

- `workshops/`: This folder contains all the exercises and practical examples.
- `docs/`: Here you’ll find my notes and important points that I’ve taken during the
  lessons.

Feel free to explore the folders and check out the work I’ve done. If you have any
questions or suggestions, please let me know!
